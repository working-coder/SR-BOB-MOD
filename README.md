#HEY, THANKS FOR CHECKING OUT MY SLIMERANCHER BOB MOD
#IF YOU ARE READING THIS I ASSUME YOU EITHER WANT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS OR JUST TO READ A BIT ABOUT IF AFTER SEEING MY REDDIT POST.

so if you are looking for installation guide, process is as follows(REQUIRES VERSION 0.3.4):



step 1 : install Assembly-CSharp.dll

step 2 : go to slime rancher folder

step 3 : from slime rancher folder go to "SlimeRancher_Data"

step 4 : from there go to "Managed"

(OPTINAL) step 4.5 : rename the existing "Assembly-CSharp.dll" to "Assembly-CSharp-Backup.dll" so you'll have a backup and be able to restore the original game code if you feel like it.

step 5 : paste and replace the file downloaded in step 1.

step 6 : enjoy.

if you encounter any issues post them in the issues tab, ill take a look and try to help. GL
